# Speech Enhancement using Deep convolutional Encoder-Decoder architectute
---
#### The following project is an approach to remove noise from common audio like phone call recordings.

##### Each phase of the project is present in the following files:
Data processing : [Notebook](https://github.com/SreemukhMantripragada/SpeechEnhancement/blob/main/Data%20Processing.ipynb)  
Model building and testing : [Notebook](https://github.com/SreemukhMantripragada/SpeechEnhancement/blob/main/Model%20training%20and%20testing%20.ipynb)


Trying out the model : [Notebook](https://github.com/SreemukhMantripragada/SpeechEnhancement/blob/main/Using%20the%20model.ipynb)  
In place of the noisy audio clip that is synthetically generated, we can try out the model on real life sounds by loading the sound clip.
